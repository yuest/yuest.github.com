#Non-blocking Gist Embed Code Via jQuery
<!-- date: 2011-03-28 00:00 -->

The default GitHub Gist embed code will block your web page (and your static external resource files such as css and js) from loading, which will produce a very bad user experience for your visitor. I just wrote a few code to make it non-blocking. It's implemented with jQuery but I think it's easy to port to fit another framework/library.

Here's the code:

<div data-gist-id=889189><a href="http://gist.github.com/889189">non-blocking_gist_embed_code.js on GitHub Gist</a></div>
